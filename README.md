# Bitcoin
The main goal of the project is to explore the application of statistical and computational techniques to predict the price of Bitcoin.
• Firstly, perform exploratory analysis of your dataset to highlight any interesting features (note that these should relate to better understanding the dynamics of cryptocurrencies).
• Secondly, apply inferential techniques to explore the possibility of constructing a model which will predict the Bitcoin price from data on a range of independent variables.
